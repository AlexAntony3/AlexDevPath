# Alex's Dev Path

## Introduction
Alex's Dev Path is a full stack website developed to show off my path into coding, my skills, portfolio and a user interface for users to link with myself.

The website allows a user to create an account, from there, the user can create, read, update and delete appointments. This responsive website was created using agile principles, bootstrap and the django frameworks. So if you're interested in working with me, or want to enquire about more, pleease let me know and enjoy!
