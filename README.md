# Alex's Dev Path

## Introduction
Alex's Dev Path is a full stack website developed to show off my path into coding, my skills, portfolio and a user interface for users to link with myself.

The website allows a user to create an account, from there, the user can create, read, update and delete appointments. This responsive website was created using agile principles, bootstrap and the django frameworks. So if you're interested in working with me, or want to enquire about more, pleease let me know and enjoy!

## Agile Methodologies
As mentioned in the introduciton, agile principles were utilised throughout this project to plan and complete all aspects of the project. The agile method that was mainly utilised in this project was the use of GitHub issues which were further categorised into milestones to seperate out tasks for various aspects of the project. The issues were then added onto a Kanban project board through GitHub as shown below:

The main GitHub issues laid out were user stories, each user stories contains acceptance criteria. These requirements were sometimes adjusted as through the course of the project, unplanned events and new ideas occurred therefore this was added or deleted as required. 

Another agile principle used was the MoSCoW method. The MoSCoW prioritisation method enabled me to understand what elements within the project were 'must haves', 'should have' or 'could have'. This allowed me to make sure that I spent the most amount of time ensuring that the must haves were completed first.

## User Experience (UX)

### Site Owner Goals

- I would like the user to be able to understand what the website is about straight away from the home page.
- A form is required whereby the user can create a meeting with myself for any coding related topics.
- Validation is required throughout to provide users with any feedback required.
- I can review the database to manage user's forms and requirements.
- A separate staff login for myself and staff to manage CRUD functionality for appointments made. 
- Professional and modern design.

### User Stories

- As a user, I expect every web page to be consistent with the same header and footer.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the work history of the Alex.
- As a user, I want to be able to see a picture of Alex with a short description about himself.
- As a user, I expect an easily navigatable web page that is simple.
- As a user, I want to be able to see skills, proficincies and expectations of the site owner.
- As a user, I expect to be able to be register an account.
- As a user, I expect to be able to create an appointment with the site owner whilst being logged in.
- As a user, I expect to view appointments set up with Alex whilst being logged in.
- As a user, I expect to be able to follow Alex on social media through the footer.

### Staff Member Stories

- As a staff member, I expect to have a higher access account compared to the user.
- As a staff member, I expect to be able to edit appointments set up with Alex whilst being logged in.
- As a staff member, I expect to be able to delete appointments set up with Alex whilst being logged in.
- As a staff member, I expect to be able to log out of my account to keep my details secure.

### Developer Goals

- The site should restrict users from entering invalid data into forms
- The form must contain placeholder text in all fields to make it easier for the user to use.
- A notification must appear when a user has successfully logged in.
- A notification must appear when a user has logged out.
- The website is viable and accessible on all browsers.
- The website attractive and different when compared to other portfolio websites to make it stand out.
- The website is responsive to multiple different size screens.

### Expectations

- I expect there to be confirmations and notifications of CRUD functionality.
- I expect that when creating an account, the username must be unique and not copyable.
- I expect there to be restrictions as to the limit of what a user can do.
- I expect there to be less restriction as to the limit of what a staff member can do.

### Requirements

- The website must be intuitive to use.
- The website must be unique and entice the user to stay.
- Any errors must display and allow the user to understand why the error occurred.
- The website must be responsive to all screen sizes.
- The colour pallette must be consistent all the way through.

## Design

The design aspect of the website is a challenging topic as I religiously use pastel colours which I have seen to not be a great hit when it comes to enticing a user to stay in the website and also to make it stand out the crowd. For this reason, I completed a questionnaire which was completed by my collegues and friends to see what colour scheme they would prefer to see in a portfolio related page. The design choices laid ahead are the decisions made from the answers in the questionnaire. 

### Colour Scheme

The interview questions feedback gained meant that the following colour scheme was selected. The main properties to be concerned about with the colour scheme was the fact that the text colour is required to contrast against the background so that all text is legible. Another property to be mindful was to also try and avoid only using pastel colours and make sure that the colour scheme is modern. The colour scheme below was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/?home "Coolors")

![colour palette](docs/colour_palette.png "Colour Palette")

| Colour (Hex) | Use |
|--|--|
|#8ECAE6|The lightest of all the colours in the palette, this colour is used for the minor elements such as the border for images. |
|#219EBC|This is the second shade of blue that is used in this webpage. It is to be used as contrasting text colour when compared to the other orange colours used.|
|#023047|This final blue shade is the darkest and also the main colour scheme of the website, this colour will be used primarily as the background colour.|
|#FFB703|This initial shade of yellow is used for contrasting text colour when a blue background is present.|
|#FB8500|This is the second main colour in the webpage, this colour is primarily used as the pop out colour from the background. This colour will be used to display important information and draw the users eyes to it.|

### Icons

Multiple icons are used throughout the webapge, this is to increase the user experience and make the purpose of buttons / information sources easier to understand. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") was used as the source of the icons.
[Favicon](https://favicon.io "Favicon") was also another source of icon used however this supplied an identifier for the website when a user visits. The icon is recognisable and is indicative of the type of website.

### Font

As the webpage is designed to show my professional and educational life, it was important to show where my current path has led and to reflect that, the fonts that were decided on were: 
* Source Code Pro is the main font for all text within the website, this portrays a coding stlye making it relevant to the website purpose. Furthermore the readability of the font is clear and spaced out well.
* Kanit is the other font used in the project, this font is to be used for all titles and the logo. It is a clear bold font and it stands out from the page.
