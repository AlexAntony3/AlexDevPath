# Alex's Dev Path

## Introduction
Alex's Dev Path is a full stack website developed to show off my path into coding, my skills, portfolio and a user interface for users to link with myself.

The website allows a user to create an account, from there, the user can create, read, update and delete appointments. This responsive website was created using agile principles, bootstrap and the django frameworks. So if you're interested in working with me, or want to enquire about more, pleease let me know and enjoy!

## Agile Methodologies
As mentioned in the introduciton, agile principles were utilised throughout this project to plan and complete all aspects of the project. The agile method that was mainly utilised in this project was the use of GitHub issues which were further categorised into milestones to seperate out tasks for various aspects of the project. 

The main GitHub issues laid out were user stories, each user stories contains acceptance criteria. These requirements were sometimes adjusted as through the course of the project, unplanned events and new ideas occurred therefore this was added or deleted as required. 

Another agile principle used was the MoSCoW method. The MoSCoW prioritisation method enabled me to understand what elements within the project were 'must haves', 'should have' or 'could have'. This allowed me to make sure that I spent the most amount of time ensuring that the must haves were completed first.
