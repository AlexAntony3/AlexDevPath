    As a product release coordinator with a passion for programming, I bring a unique blend of skills to the table.
    With a background in chemistry and experience in the pharmaceutical manufacturing field, I have developed a
    strong foundation in quality control and assurance, as well as expertise in organic and inorganic chemistry,
    including NMR.

    Now, as I pursue my interest in computers and coding, I am completing a full stack development course by Code
    Institute to expand my skill set and explore new possibilities. I am excited to apply my analytical and
    problem-solving skills to the world of technology, and eager to see where this new journey takes me.
